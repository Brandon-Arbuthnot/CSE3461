\begin{enumerate}

\item[1]\textbf{(8 points)} Suppose users share a 3 Mbps link. Each user requires 150 kbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 10\% of the time

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported? 

  	20 Users can be supported because each user requires only 1/20th of the bandwith.

  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Assume packet switching is used for the rest of this problem. Find the probability that a given user is transmitting.

  	The probability that a given user is transmitting is $P =  20/100 = 0.20 = 20\%$

  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Suppose there are 120 users. Find the probability that exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously at any given time. (Hint: Use the binomial distribution.)

  	$P=\binom{120}{n} * 0.1^n * (0.9)^{120-n}$

  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Find the probability that there are 21 or more users transmitting simultaneously.

  	$P = \sum_{\substack{n=0}}^{21} \binom{120}{n}0.1^n * 0.9^{120-n}$

\end{enumerate}

\item[2]\textbf{(8 points)} A client is fetching a base HTML file with $k$ referenced objects $(k > 0)$ from an Internet server. Let the RTT be $r$. Assume that the transmission/reception time for each file and referenced objects, if any, is $d$. Further, the only transmission/reception bottleneck in the network is the access link through which the client is connected to the Internet. In terms of $r, k,$ and $d$, compute the following delay for the following scenarios

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Non-persistent HTTP with parallel TCP connections (there is no limit on the number of parallel connections).
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Non-persistent HTTP with no parallel TCP connections.
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Persistent HTTP with pipelining.
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Persistent HTTP without pipelining.
  \end{enumerate}
 
\item[3]\textbf{(4 points)}Compare and contrast wired and wireless networks. You can find information in the textbook and online. Please cite all references you found

\item[4]\textbf{(6 points)} Consider the figure below. Answer the following questions. Assume we know the bottleneck link along the path from the server to the client is the first link with rate $R\textsubscript{S}$ bit/s. Suppose we send a pair of packets back to back from the server to the client and there is no other traffic on the path. Assume each packet has size $L$ bits and both links have the same propagation delay $d\textsubscript{prop}$.

	\begin{enumerate}
    	\item \textbf{(3 points)} What is the packet inter-arrival time at the destination? That is, how much time elapses from when the last bit of the first packet arrives until the last bit of the second packet arrives?
        \item \textbf{(3 points)} Now assume that the second link is the bottleneck link (i.e., $R\textsubscript{c} < R\textsubscript{s}$. Is it possible that the second packet queues at the input queue of the second link? Explain. Now suppose that the server sends the second packet $T$ seconds after sending the first packet. How large must $T$ be to ensure no queueing before the second link? Explain.	
    \end{enumerate}
    
\item[5]\textbf{(8 points)} Read the \texttt{man} pages for \texttt{nslookup(1)} and \texttt{whois(1)}. If you are not very familiar with UNIX man pages, start with \texttt{man man}. For all parts below, describe the commands you use to obtain your answers.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Use \texttt{nslookup} and send DNS queries to \texttt{www.cse.ohio-state.edu}. Search for Type A, NS, and MX records and summarize your findings.
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Use \texttt{nslookup} to find a Web server that has multiple IP addresses. Does the server \texttt{www.osu.edu} have multiple IP addresses?
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} What are the names and IP addresses of the authoritative name servers for the following machines: \texttt{www.csail.mit.edu} and \texttt{cs.illinois.edu}?
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} What are the names and IP addresses of the machines on which email servers for the following recipients is running: \texttt{champion@cse.ohio-state.edu} and \texttt{person@cs.ucla.edu}? (If there are several mail server machines, provide information on only one).
  \end{enumerate}

\item[6]\textbf{(6 points)} This question asks you to perform \texttt{traceroute} to various hosts. For all parts below, describe the commands you use to obtain your answers.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Perform \texttt{traceroute} to two hosts, each in a different city in CHina. Submit a printout of the two \texttt{traceroute} operation from the site. How many links are the same in the two \texttt{traceroutes}? Is the transpacific link the same?
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Repeat (a) but choose one city in china and another city in India.
  \item \textbf{(2 points)} Perform two \texttt{traceroutes} to two hosts, each in a different city in Europe. How many links are common to the two \texttt{traceroutes}? Do the \texttt{traceroutes} diverge before reaching Europe?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
